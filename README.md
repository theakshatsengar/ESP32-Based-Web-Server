Web server running on the ESP32 microcontroller
Basic webpage served to clients accessing the ESP32's IP address
Easily customizable webpage content and functionality

Requirements
ESP32 development board
Arduino IDE or PlatformIO
ESP32 board support package installed in the IDE
USB cable for programming and powering the ESP32

Getting Started
Clone or download the project repository.
Open the project in the Arduino IDE or PlatformIO.
Connect your ESP32 development board to your computer using a USB cable.
Select the appropriate board and port in the IDE.
Upload the code to the ESP32.
Open a web browser and enter the IP address of the ESP32 to view the webpage.

Usage
Customize the webpage by modifying the HTML code in the index.html file.
Modify the server behavior by editing the Arduino code in the ESP32_Web_Server.ino file.
